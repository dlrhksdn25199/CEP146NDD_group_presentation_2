### Summary
______________________________________________________

### Key Findings
- 690+ FDA-approved AI/ML devices, with ~75% in radiology where imaging strongly complements machine learning.
- Reliability concerns identified by the 2025 JAMA study: limited dataset transparency, performance drops in new environments, and sparse demographic reporting.
- Industry growth of ~60% (2022–2024) due to rising investment, workforce shortages, and demand for faster diagnostics.
- Regulatory gaps driven by adaptive AI behavior, undisclosed training data, privacy concerns, and insufficient post-market monitoring.

### Discussion Question
> How can healthcare regulators and developers collaboratively ensure transparent data practices, fairness across demographic groups, and continuous validation for adaptive AI systems while still enabling innovation at the pace required by modern healthcare?
