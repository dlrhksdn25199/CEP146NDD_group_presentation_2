### Summary
This research examines the growth of FDA-approved AI medical devices between 2024 and 2025. The FDA database shows more than 690 AI-enabled devices, with radiology dominating approvals. A 2025 JAMA study highlights concerns about fairness, generalizability, and lack of demographic transparency. MedTech Dive reports a 60% increase in approvals driven by hospital adoption and industry investment. IntuitionLabs outlines regulatory challenges such as adaptive AI oversight and post-market monitoring. Overall, AI in healthcare is expanding rapidly, but reliability, transparency, and safety remain critical considerations for developers and regulators.

### Key Findings
- 690+ FDA-approved AI/ML devices, with ~75% in radiology where imaging strongly complements machine learning.
- Reliability concerns identified by the 2025 JAMA study: limited dataset transparency, performance drops in new environments, and sparse demographic reporting.
- Industry growth of ~60% (2022–2024) due to rising investment, workforce shortages, and demand for faster diagnostics.
- Regulatory gaps driven by adaptive AI behavior, undisclosed training data, privacy concerns, and insufficient post-market monitoring.

### Discussion Question
> How can healthcare regulators and developers collaboratively ensure transparent data practices, fairness across demographic groups, and continuous validation for adaptive AI systems while still enabling innovation at the pace required by modern healthcare?
