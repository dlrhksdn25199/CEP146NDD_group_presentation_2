## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence has rapidly expanded into healthcare, especially within diagnostic imaging and clinical decision-support systems. Between 2024 and 2025, the FDA authorized hundreds of AI-enabled medical devices across radiology, cardiology, ophthalmology, and emergency care. This project analyzes the growth patterns, reliability, and regulatory considerations of FDA-approved medical AI technologies while highlighting real-world case studies of systems already in use.
