# AI in Healthcare

## Slide 1 — Introduction
**AI in Healthcare**
- Rapid growth in FDA-authorized AI devices  
- Dominant use in diagnostic imaging  
- Analysis of trends, reliability, and regulation  

**Speaker Notes:**  
AI adoption—especially in imaging—is accelerating. Hundreds of devices are FDA authorized, mostly in radiology, but also cardiology, ophthalmology, and emergency care.

## Slide 2 — FDA-Authorized Devices (Overview)
**FDA AI/ML Devices**
- 690+ approved systems  
- Radiology = ~75% of approvals  
- Most pass through the 510(k) pathway  
- Other categories: ophthalmology, cardiology, oncology, emergency care  

**Speaker Notes:**  
Radiology leads because imaging pairs well with machine learning. The 510(k) pathway shows many devices are “substantially equivalent” to past approved tools.

## Slide 3 — Reliability & Generalizability Issues
**Concerns from 2025 JAMA Study**
- Limited transparency on training datasets  
- Accuracy may drop in new clinical environments  
- Few demographic performance breakdowns  
- Risks of bias and inconsistent results  

**Speaker Notes:**  
FDA-authorized devices often fail to generalize to hospitals with different populations or equipment. Demographic reporting is rare, raising fairness concerns.

## Slide 4 — Industry Growth (MedTech Dive)
**Industry Trends (2022–2024)**
- 60% increase in AI device approvals  
- Hospitals adopt AI to reduce diagnostic delays  
- Growth beyond radiology into cardiology and oncology  
- Rising investment from startups and MedTech companies  

**Speaker Notes:**  
Workforce shortages and diagnostic backlogs fuel AI adoption.

## Slide 5 — Regulatory Challenges
**Key Regulatory Issues**
- Adaptive AI changes behavior over time  
- Training data often proprietary or undisclosed  
- Patient-data privacy concerns  
- Need for continuous post-market performance monitoring  

**Speaker Notes:**  
Adaptive systems make regulation difficult because their accuracy can shift after deployment.

## Slide 6 — Case Studies
**Examples of FDA-Authorized Systems**
- **Viz.ai Stroke Detection:** Real-time CT-based stroke triage  
- **IDx-DR:** Autonomous diabetic retinopathy diagnostic tool  
- **HeartFlow FFR-CT:** 3D coronary artery modeling from CT  
- **Caption Guidance:** Real-time ultrasound capture assistance  

**Speaker Notes:**  
These represent emergency triage, ophthalmology, cardiology, and imaging support.

## Slide 7 — Benefits
**Benefits of Medical AI**
- Faster diagnosis  
- Less clinician workload  
- Early disease detection  
- Improved access in low-resource areas  
- More consistent imaging quality  

**Speaker Notes:**  
AI accelerates workflows and helps standardize imaging interpretation.

---

## Slide 8 — Concerns
**Risks & Limitations**
- Algorithmic bias  
- Accuracy variations across hospitals  
- Data privacy vulnerabilities  
- Oversight complexity for adaptive AI  
- Overreliance on automated recommendations  

**Speaker Notes:**  
Bias and reliability issues are major unresolved concerns.

## Slide 9 — Summary
**Overall Findings**
- Rapid expansion of FDA-approved AI (690+ devices)  
- Radiology dominates approvals  
- Reliability and fairness issues remain  
- Regulation evolving to address adaptive AI  

**Speaker Notes:**  
AI is expanding rapidly, but transparent data practices and strong regulation are key for long-term safety and trust.
